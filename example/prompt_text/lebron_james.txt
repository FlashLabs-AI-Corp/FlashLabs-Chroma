um,you know, offensive drills, defensive drills, shell drill, um, you know, shooting drills, um, all type of things. So, just like a regular practice with the, with the South Bay guys. And like I said, I'm super appreciative and, and, and humble to be able to go out there. And then they'll, you know, kind of change their practice a little bit to kind of fit me as well. So, just super cool.
